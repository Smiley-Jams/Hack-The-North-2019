# Eternity

The main pillars that make up *Eternity* are progression, collaboration, and decentralization.

- To achieve progression, players can level up certain skills like gathering or crafting
- To achieve collaboration, players will have to trade resources with other players to craft better items.
- To achieve decentralization, the game's data will all be stored by blockchain

The game world is grid based, with each tile of the grid containing information about the quantity of different types of resources it contains. The *tick* of the game will run every certain time interval, and all each tick does is give the players resources based on the tile that they are occupying.

## Core Game Loop

The items will be the goal of the game, these items could be cosmetic so it could be shown off to other players.

## Auction House
