# Eternal

A thriving civilization will eventually end, but they are not forgotten. Humans work to preserve the history of our world and the people inhabiting it, but what of the virtual worlds that many inhabit in their free time?

_Eternal_ is a resource management MMO game built on blockchain technology. Players collect resources and explore the world, trading with others to get the best equipment for their specialization. The distributed blockchain nature of the game provides several advantages over a traditional, centralized game server. Eternal can never disappear due to servers shutting down. It's incredibly secure against hackers. Further, the entire history of the game can be accessed on the chain, allowing anyone to view the game's evolution, no matter when they start playing.

_Eternal_ combines Ubisoft's Nest API for games with Algorand's blockchain technology.
